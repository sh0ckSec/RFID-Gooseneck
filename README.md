# RFID Gooseneck

Traditional RFID badge cloning methods require you to be within 3 feet of your target, so how can you conduct a socially distanced physical penetration test and clone a badge if you must stay at least 6 feet from a person? Since 2020, companies have increasingly adopted a hybrid work environment, allowing employees to partially work remotely, which has decreased the amount of foot traffic in and out of a building at any given time. After throwing around some ideas, I thought, why not create a mobile long-range reader device that we could deploy early in the morning at a client site and let it do all the work for us.  This project guide contains an entry-level hardware design that you can build in a day and deploy in the field in order to increase your chances of remotely cloning an RFID badge.

This is part of an original full paper and talk given during **DEFCON 30** in the Physical Bypass Village **Keeping Your Distance: Pwning RFID Physical Access Controls From 6FT and Beyond** by myself and Twitter: @_badcharacters (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLLaXOcuYfw). Each year (DEFCON 31, 32 and 33), the content is reiterated and improved upon, staying up on the latest techniques and gadgets to use in the field. The goal is to conduct a physical pen test without the need for a laptop, only a mobile phone and implant devices!



The content has been updated for **DEFCON 33** titled: **Flipping Locks: Remote Badge Cloning with the Flipper Zero and More**. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to clone the badge loot from your RFID Gooseneck reader quickly and easily!

### Here's the full build guide for making your own RFID Goosneck Long Range Reader! 

# Gooseneck Base Installation Guide 
Ok, let's do this. 

### Wooden Base BOM:
* MDF or Plywood (16"x16"x0.5")
* Non-Slip Furniture Feet: https://a.co/d/8oR8tHj  
* Pedestal Pro 36"H Gooseneck: https://bit.ly/3bCz6go
* 3/8" x 1 1/4" Carriage Bolts and Wing Nuts and Washers (Quantity of 6 each) 
* Black Spray Paint

### Step 1 - Cut Out Wood Base
* If you have access to a laser cutter or a ShopBot, feel free to download the "GooseneckBaseMK2Template_sh0ck" template file(s) or cut out your own 16"x16" piece of MDF or plywood. 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104524120/183817491-c6211d51-2ad0-4fdc-9640-4c3279d4e3e6.PNG" width=40% height=40%>


### Step 2 - Align Pedestal
* Center the gooseneck pedestal and place the edge of the base approximately 1.25" away from the edge of the base. The 1.25" (3.175cm) distance from the edge will counter-balance the weight of the long-range reader so it will not tip over when installed. 
* Next trace and drill the 3/8" mounting holes.

### Step 3 - Paint
* Spray the base with a matte black color of your choice.
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104524120/183312993-d70ecfc4-aa1c-4495-b196-3730f4b221fc.jpg" width=30% height=30%>


### Step 4 - Install Feet 
* When the paint is dry, drill the non-slip furniture feet onto the bottom of the base.

### Step 5 - Fasten Pedestal to Base 
Last, fasten the pedestal to the wooden base with bolts and wingnuts. Then place the pedestal cover over the top to conceal the screws.

# Long Range Reader Cloning Guide
Let's build the long-range reader cloning device. 
### Long Range Reader BOM: 
* ESP RFID Tool: https://hackerwarehouse.com/product/esp-rfid-tool/
* Low-Frequency Long Range Reader (e.g., HID MaxiProx 5375) OR High-Frequency Long Range Reader (e.g., HID iCLASS SE R90) 
* Breadboard Jumper Wires - 3.9in (10cm): https://a.co/d/fja090p or 22AWG Wire: https://a.co/d/h7bbBom 
* 18AWG 12V 5A DC Power Pigtail Barrel Plug Connector Cable: https://a.co/d/7l56UFQ
* 12V 6000mAh/5V 12000mAh DC Battery: https://a.co/d/9czvggQ
* 3M Dual Lock Clear Velcro: https://a.co/d/gg4SzBd

### Wiring Guide 
Below is an example of the wiring guide to connect to a long-range reader with screw-in terminals using the ESP RFID Tool. Use the color-coded male-to-male breadboard wires to connect the two terminal interfaces between the Wiegand system and the ESP RFID Tool, as seen below.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104524120/183313184-f8f62a73-4bb1-403b-8c65-bfd9d5edac78.PNG" width=80% height=80%>

* Then connect the 12V 5A DC Power Pigtail Barrel Plug Male Connector cable into the Wiegand system (HID iClass SE R90 pictured) and trail the cable to the outside of the reader so you can plug it into the 12V 6000mAh DC Battery. 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104524120/183816676-e13ef2d6-b493-4d49-baa1-03c0f9d288a2.jpg" width=40% height=40%>

The same wiring applies to the low-frequency HID MaxiProx 5375 reader. 

<img src="https://github.com/sh0ckSec/RFID-Gooseneck/assets/104524120/1093738d-37ee-41df-a2d2-f16fe91940dd" width=40% height=40%>

Close-up of HID MaxiProx 5375 Wiring:

*WARNING:* Ensure when you are working with the HID MaxiProx 5375 that you change the jumper on the Shunt Pins settings from 2 and 3 +21-2.85 VDC (Default) TO Shunt Pins 1 and 2 +11.6-20.9VDC) because we are using a 12V battery. If you do not switch the jumper, you will fry the unit! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED! Double-check this for any reader you are working with, just in case. 

<img src="https://github.com/sh0ckSec/RFID-Gooseneck/assets/104524120/b41eb1ec-1524-4aae-b135-6da0f19b80b5" width=40% height=40%>

To remain as stealthy as possible, it is advised to turn off the audible "beep" if the reader allows you to. In this case, we can silence the beep on the HID MaxiProx 5375 reader by pushing down dipswitch #4 of SW1 (the farthest right of the switch sets).

# Battery Mounting
Once you have wired everything, take 3M Dual Lock Velcro and affix it to the back of the battery and the back of the reader. This will ensure the battery will stay firm throughout the engagement and it looks like it is part of the unit.

# Mounting Reader to Pedestal
Depending on the reader, you must find the correct mounting hole guide for each. You will have to manually drill holes into the back of the reader in order to center it to the gooseneck pedestal with carriage bolts and nuts. Below is an example mount guide for the HID iCLASS R90.

# Flipper Zero - Cloning Low-Frequency Cards 
To remain incognito while at the client site, cloning a card with a mobile phone and a Flipper Zero hidden away will keep the lowest profile rather than fiddling with a laptop when you need to copy the card data. 

### Mobile Cloning Gear:
* Mobile Phone (Android or iOS)
* Flipper Zero: https://shop.flipperzero.one/
* Flipper Mobile App: https://docs.flipper.net/mobile-app 
* RFID T5557 Rewritable Cards: https://a.co/d/0NF2zJG

<img src="https://github.com/sh0ckSec/RFID-Gooseneck/assets/104524120/c7e42376-441a-4686-9f8f-f9d90d8ce25a" width=40% height=40%>


### Step 1  - Access RFID Loot
Once the implant is in place and a few employees have walked past the gooseneck reader, hop onto your phone and log into your RFID ESP Key SSID to look for loot. The default SSID is "ESP-RFID-Tool" but it is recommended to change the name to something that will blend into the target environment. In order to change the SSID and password to protect the ESP RFID Tool wifi (and not leak all your client's credentials to the world), jump over to the configuration page to customize the settings and change all your default passwords. 
* Default SSID: **ESP-RFID-Tool**
* URL: http://192.168.1.1


Default credentials to access the configuration page:
* Username: *admin*
* Password: *rfidtool*

(Full ESP RFID Tool user guide here: https://github.com/rfidtool/ESP-RFID-Tool)

Once you're on the ESP RFID Tool WiFi, access Data in the "List Exfiltrated Data" Page:
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104524120/183313563-2b3c480d-2005-4bf0-b2db-7d00d182feda.PNG" width=50% height=50%>

#### Note: Binary Code Breakdown 
It's not as crazy as you think, here's the breakdown of what the binary code means below:
<img width=70% height=70% alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/015e5edc-cfad-42e9-a304-2f75f65fdd03" />
Source:  https://accessgrid.com/guides/access-control-protocols/examples-of-every-access-control-bit-format 

### Step 2 - Copy the 2nd half of the Binary Payload and Convert to HEX
The "HEX" in the loot file was designed for a Proxmark 3 device. The Flipper Zero takes a different type of hex code so here's how you get your payload to clone your card. 

<img width=70% height=70% alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5565aa65-4b93-4744-8b95-2fa29dea3a33" />


Copy the second half of the binary data: ​
* 00010000100000101001110011 ​
  
REMOVE the leading and trailing parity bits:
* 001000010000010100111001

Copy this and convert it into HEX using a Bin-HEX Converter ​on your phone and poof! You have the 6 digit hex code for your Flipper!
* 001000010000010100111001 = 21 05 39​


### Step 3 - Save your Card Data to the Flipper Zero

On your Flipper, **hit the center button** and navigate to > **125 hHz RFID** > **Add Manually**
